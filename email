Team,

so far I can able to build and deploy edgeapp ui project manually from my linux dev box. I have ran into some compiling issue while building
but I solved with slight changes.

As i am new to envionment it took some time to reach here. I will automate build and deploy process with docker very soon. 

Attaching you the output after deploying to tomcat in tomcat.

Thanks,
Shaul
