Good Evening Karthik,

I can able to deploy edge app UI  project in Tomcat succesfully.

These are the steps that I foloowed for deployment process,

step1: I built edgeapp project using ngbuild locally.After building is done, I can able to see dist folder.
step2: I have built a docker file which can able to copy this dist folder to tomcat webapps folder.
step3: After copying dist folder to webapp, tomcat starts automatically with port 3000
       path of project and tomcat is as follows /edge-app-ui/dist/* /apache-tomcat-8.5.39/webapps/edge-app-ui/
       
       
If you want me to work with your team to get this deployment process up and running i can work with them to get it up and running.

Thank you,
Shaul
